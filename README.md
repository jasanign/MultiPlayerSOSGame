# MultiPlayerSOSGame
This game is made of a S.O.S. game server and a simple game client. The server accepts incoming TCP connections on a specified port. The server supports two types of messaging modes: broadcast and private. With broadcast mode, messages received from any client are sent back to all other connected clients. With private mode, messages are directed to a single peer client. The clients and server applications communication with each other via TCP. Also the server keeps track of client scores, turns, and validates client moves on the board.
